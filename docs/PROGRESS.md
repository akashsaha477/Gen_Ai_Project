# PROGRESS

## 2026-10-08 (Day 2) — Phase 1

Done:
- Kit installed at the repo root (c1bec44). Plan amended after the kickoff review, A1–A11 (39f4f29,
  `docs/DECISIONS.md`); A2 and A7 change the plan and await the whole team.
- Environment: Python 3.11 with `uv.lock` (torch 2.14.1, numpy 2.4.6, scipy 1.17.1,
  scikit-learn 1.9.1, wfdb 4.3.1).
- MIT-BIH 1.0.0 downloaded from PhysioNet. All 144 files (48 records × hea, dat, atr) match
  PhysioNet's published SHA-256 list (`results/data/raw_checksums.json`).
- Beat extraction with the AAMI map and RR intervals; per-record counts for 44 records
  (`results/data/record_counts.csv`). Totals: DS1 N 45,866, S 944, V 3,788, F 415, Q 8; DS2 N 44,259, S 1,837, V 3,221, F 388, Q 7.
  Sanity check passes: the largest deviation from the docs/RULES.md reference is S in DS1,
  944 against 942 (+0.21%)
  (`results/data/sanity_check.json`). DS1 also has 472 flutter-wave
  annotations outside the AAMI map (record 207), excluded like Q.
- Test lock in place: raw reads go through one guarded module, `load_test()` needs `ALLOW_TEST=1`.
  `docs/TEST_ACCESS_LOG.md` holds 1 construction entry (DS2 label counts) and 0 evaluation entries.
- Module 2: metrics, record-level cluster bootstrap, paired differences with bootstrap p-values, Holm,
  and the selection rule with its tie margin, all with hand-computed tests.
- Probe CNN (18,628 parameters; 18,762 with the RR side input), training loop with
  early stopping, run logging.
- Module 1: configs A–D, one brief per variant, and the runner. `--check` on DS1 gives 50,969 usable
  beats for every variant (N 45,824, S 943, V 3,788, F 414; dropped at record edges: N 42, S 1,
  V 0, F 1), an identical beat set across variants, and no non-finite values.
  Shapes: A (50969, 180), B (50969, 360), C (50969, 180), D (50969, 63) (`results/data/m1_representation_check_*.json`).
  Smoke runs on fake data pass for A–D.
- Validation-split options with DS1 per-record counts: `results/data/val_options.md`.
- Kaggle runner notebook and `kaggle/ingest_runs.py`.
- `docs/PREREGISTRATION.md` v1 drafted, status DRAFT.
- Tests: 123 pass, also in a fresh clone installed with `uv sync --frozen`.

Run IDs: none. No variant experiment has been run and no model has seen real data.

Open issues / risks:
- **Blocked on the team:** validation split, the (new) items of PREREGISTRATION v1, and plan changes
  A2 and A7.
- Nothing is pushed: `main` is ahead of `origin/main` by every commit since "Papers".
- The Kaggle notebook has not been executed on Kaggle. The repository is private, so it needs a
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` Kaggle secret.
- `wfdb.dl_database` took about 29 minutes here. The last files were fetched in parallel with curl from
  the same PhysioNet URLs; the checksum match covers every file. On Kaggle, attach the verified raw
  files as a private dataset (`RAW_DATASET_DIR` in the notebook) instead of downloading each session.
- The AAMI +P convention for V (fusion beats called V are not false positives) is implemented from
  memory of de Chazal et al. (2004) and must be checked against the paper before it is quoted.
  The plain precision for V is reported next to it.
- Contract arrays can differ in the last bit between platforms (filtering, resampling). The frozen
  contract must be built once and distributed as files; loaders verify the hash.
- Wall-clock of a Module 1 variant run is not measured yet.
- This laptop has about 11 GB of free disk.
- Commit 2f18fa1 lacks the data package because `.gitignore` matched `src/ecgaug/data/`; fixed in
  410986b. The commits in between do not pass their tests on their own.
- matplotlib's font scan fails on this macOS version; `ecgaug.eval.plotting.import_pyplot()` works
  around it (see README).

Next:
1. Team decides the validation split and approves PREREGISTRATION v1 (with or without A2 and A7).
2. Then: write `configs/splits/approved.yaml`, fill §2, set the status to IN FORCE, commit, tag
   `prereg-v1`, push.
3. Draw the Module 1 assignments (`docs/ASSIGNMENTS.md`); each member runs `/variant 1 <letter>`.
4. `/gate 1`.

## 2026-10-09 (Day 3) — Phase 1

Done:
- Commit messages rewritten as short one-liners; history pushed to GitHub.
- Kaggle setup for the team: one notebook, a runner script, a raw-data zip builder (66 MB zip of the
  verified MIT-BIH files) and a guide. Rehearsed in a fresh clone on a laptop; not yet run on Kaggle.
- All Kaggle files moved to a top-level `kaggle/` folder (guide is `kaggle/README.md`).
- README gained a status section and a folder map.

Run IDs: none.

Open issues / risks:
- Validation split and variant assignments still undecided; Phase 1 was due today.

Next:
- Decide the validation split, draw assignments, run variants A–D.

## 2026-10-13 (Day 7) — Phase 1

Done:
- Validation split decided: option V1 (validation records 115, 118, 201, 205, 223), stored in
  `configs/splits/approved.yaml`. Selection metric: S F1 with V F1 as tie-break.
- The runner no longer checks `docs/PREREGISTRATION.md`; a variant runs with the approved split and a
  committed tree. The document is kept as a description of the rules.
- Dataset decision recorded: MIT-BIH only. PTB-XL was considered and rejected as the main dataset
  because it has no beat-level labels.
- Tests: 121 pass.

Run IDs: none. No variant has been run yet.

Open issues / risks:
- About four days behind the plan (Phase 2 was due to end on Day 8). The Day 15 buffer is used up.
- Open question: pretrain on PTB-XL and fine-tune on MIT-BIH. Proposed as one extra baseline arm in
  Phase 2, not as a change to the main study. Not decided; nothing built for it.
- Variant assignments are still TBD in `docs/ASSIGNMENTS.md`.
- The Kaggle notebook has not been executed on Kaggle. Wall-clock of a variant run is unmeasured.
- Two commits are local only (approved split, dataset decision) until pushed.

Next:
1. Push, draw assignments, run `/variant 1 A..D` (locally or on Kaggle).
2. `/gate 1`: pick the input representation and freeze the dataset.
3. Decide the PTB-XL pretraining question before Phase 2 starts.
